## Hi there, I'm king-wkðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on research related to real-time video transmission, especially focusing on architectures like WebRTC. Iâ€™m particularly interested in bandwidth estimation, forward error correction (FEC), and bitrate control.
- âš¡ Iâ€™ve previously worked on enhancing VOD (Video on Demand) video quality with super-resolution techniques, and have interned in the short video industry, focusing on video clarity optimization.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also learning about game development, though Iâ€™m still in the early stages.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to video transmission, real-time streaming technologies, and game development.
